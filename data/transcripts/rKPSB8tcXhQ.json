a", "start": 165.33, "duration": 4.59}, {"text": "blend isn't also the answer those of you", "start": 167.13, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "know that know you know image software", "start": 169.92,

"you've got more detail but it's all just", "start": 212.97, "duration": 4.05}, {"text": "kind of like mashed in together and what", "start": 214.59, "duration": 5.43}, {"text": "we want is like very clear like lumps", "start": 217.02, "duration": 7.77}, {"text": "like like big big bumps so if we look at", "start": 220.02, "duration": 6.45}, {"text": "the factor in but we can kind of see why",

actually doing now", "start": 276.41, "duration": 5.43}, {"text": "okay it does get a little it looks a", "start": 279.01, "duration": 5.29}, {"text": "little confusing but I'll show you that",

the final", "start": 293.78, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "shader and you can see it looks a little", "start": 295.25, "duration": 6.66}, {"text": "bit cleaner right now you can turn if", "start": 298.82, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "you feel that the small detail is a", "start": 301.91, "duration": 2.97}, {"text": "little too high which I think it is", "start": 303.62, "duration": 3.78},

the bottom input is the", "start": 309.77, "duration": 3.09}, {"text": "one which is always controlled by this", "start": 311.63, "duration": 3.51}, {"text": "the top input is always at a hundred",

"duration": 3.57}, {"text": "be the one which is farthest out so I", "start": 319.07, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "think it actually makes sense to put the", "start": 320.93, "duration": 3.87}, {"text": "large scale detail on the top input and", "start": 322.43, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "then actually use the decider to decide", "start": 324.8, "duration": 4.17}, {"text": "how much of the small detail to let", "start": 327.17, "duration": 3.51}, {"text": "through and now I think that actually", "start": 328.97, "duration": 4.23}, {"text": "has a better control because we can", "start": 330.68, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "actually have that kind of lumpy look", "start": 333.2, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "and then bring in as much small detail", "start": 334.64, "duration": 4.17},

percent and", "start": 340.58, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "that's kind of cool I might actually", "start": 342.61, "duration": 4.21}, {"text": "turn that up to two thousand for the", "start": 344.96, "duration": 4.709}, {"text": "small detail and I think that's pretty", "start": 346.82, "duration": 3.59}, {"text": "good", "start": 349.669, "duration": 3.931}, {"text": "not too shabby by the way I hope you", "start": 350.41, "duration": 4.81}, {"text": "can't hear but somebody is vacuuming", "start": 353.6, "duration": 3.78}, {"text": "it's a Sunday come in he had to do some", "start": 355.22,

"clean is it here of course but anyways", "start": 362.21, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "the bumps are good I know I'm actually", "start": 363.88, "duration": 4.45}, {"text": "I'm quite I'm quite happy with this I've", "start": 366.05, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "tried like fifty different variations of", "start": 368.33, "duration": 5.19}, {"text": "how to make this done' like the bump", "start": 371.27, "duration": 3.45}, {"text": "pots how to make it look good and i", "start": 373.52, "duration": 4.05}, {"text": "think this is one of the best so yay I'm", "start": 374.72, "duration": 5.73},

that would kind", "start": 382.43, "duration": 4.95}, {"text": "of be a waste because most things in the", "start": 384.56, "duration": 4.02}, {"text": "real world like if it's affecting the", "start": 387.38, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "bump of this it's also going to affect", "start": 388.58, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "the color of it like if we look at the", "start": 389.96,

"darker", "start": 396.289, "duration": 3.511}, {"text": "then the stuff underneath it and I", "start": 397.58, "duration": 3.57}, {"text": "believe it's because it's like it's", "start": 399.8,

412.58, "duration": 5.459}, {"text": "we could make we could take the value of", "start": 415.669, "duration": 4.381}, {"text": "of this actually let's move this shader", "start": 418.039, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "over so it's a little easier to", "start": 420.05, "duration": 2.429}, {"text": "understand", "start": 421.219, "duration": 3.181}, {"text": "so this is this is the data that's",

4.981}, {"text": "drive this into the base color but just", "start": 428.0, "duration": 5.25}, {"text": "like before when we were using the you", "start": 431.33, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "know single input yeah", "start": 433.25, "duration": 4.139}, {"text": "it'll only take one input and we don't", "start": 435.53, "duration": 5.819}, {"text": "want it to look like a donut that was",

right here and what I", "start": 459.529, "duration": 4.591}, {"text": "want to do is I want to take the output", "start": 462.139, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "of this and I want to put this into the", "start": 464.12, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "fact input okay so let's just move this", "start": 466.219, "duration": 5.79}, {"text": "along I'm trying to get it all in the", "start": 470.0,

this and you can see", "start": 499.06, "duration": 5.949}, {"text": "that this this bottom value here is now", "start": 502.969, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "becoming the values that are sticking",
