"be like one of them is like .325.693", "start": 221.76, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "whatever and depending on where it is", "start": 225.36, "duration": 4.239}, {"text": "along there it's uh", "start": 227.36, "duration": 4.64}, {"text": "by default it's giving it a white value", "start": 229.599, "duration": 4.801}, {"text": "or sorry a black value and a white value", "start": 232.0,

244.0, "duration": 4.64}, {"text": "somebody's dead relatives ashes", "start": 246.239, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "sprinkled on the top", "start": 248.64, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "but what we want is something a little", "start": 250.319, "duration": 4.161}, {"text": "more lively so what we can do between", "start": 251.92, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "here so where it takes the random value", "start": 254.48, "duration": 5.039}, {"text": "and it's zero to one is we can put in", "start": 256.4, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "shift a converter", "start": 259.519, "duration": 4.081}, {"text": "color ramp", "start": 262.16, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "so if we can drop in this color ramp", "start": 263.6, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "here and put this in here nothing will", "start": 265.28, "duration": 3.919}, {"text": "have changed at the moment", "start": 267.12, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "but what this is doing is it's taken the", "start": 269.199, "duration": 4.0},

as you can guess the next step is", "start": 286.08, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "is like how do you want your sprinkles", "start": 288.72, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "to look and then how do you want to set", "start": 290.4, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "this up so", "start": 291.84, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "in my case i'm going to go with a sort", "start": 293.6, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "of a pastel", "start": 295.68, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "themed color scheme and i'm gonna go", "start": 297.36, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "with like five different sprinkle color", "start": 299.84, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "sets", "start": 302.56, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "so let's go like a blue color like this", "start": 303.44, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "and then i'm gonna go a purple color", "start": 306.4, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "and then i'm going to go a", "start": 309.36, "duration": 3.839}, {"text": "hot pink color", "start": 311.44, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "and by the way this is all referencing", "start": 313.199, "duration": 2.641}, {"text": "like", "start": 314.8, "duration": 2.959}, {"text": "stuff that i found", "start": 315.84, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "uh on the the world wide web i've got a", "start": 317.759, "duration": 4.401}, {"text": "pinterest board actually i'll put the", "start": 320.88, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "link in the description but i've found", "start": 322.16, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "like some", "start": 324.0, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "like doughnut sprinkle", "start": 325.52, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "looks that i like and uh and i decided", "start": 327.36, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "to copy kind of like the", "start": 329.68, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "yeah the color scheme but anyway it's", "start": 331.36, "duration": 3.839}, {"text": "basically what i'm doing now", "start": 333.12, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "so let's add another one i'm going to", "start": 335.199, "duration": 3.521}, {"text": "make this one yellow and then the last", "start": 337.12, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "one is going to be white", "start": 338.72, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "okay great so look at that we now have", "start": 340.56, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "looking at our donut", "start": 342.72, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "we have those sprinkles", "start": 344.4, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "whoops oh gosh what have i done we have", "start": 346.08, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "those sprinkles and they all have those", "start": 348.72, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "colors now one problem and that is that", "start": 350.88, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "um it hasn't just assigned it these", "start": 354.24, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "colors it's also assigned it every value", "start": 356.24, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "in between it so it's also giving us a", "start": 358.56, "duration": 4.079}, {"text": "value like somewhere between pink and", "start": 360.16, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "yellow like some of these sprinkles are", "start": 362.639, "duration": 3.761}, {"text": "going to be that color", "start": 364.0, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "and that's because this is a gradient", "start": 366.4, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "and there's values in between it so what", "start": 368.0, "duration": 3.199}, {"text": "we want to do is we want to change the", "start": 369.68, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "gradient type to instead of being linear", "start": 371.199, "duration": 4.801}, {"text": "we want it to be a constant inter", "start": 373.68, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "interpolation", "start": 376.0, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "so if i set that now you can see that", "start": 378.24, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "there is only it's basically now binary", "start": 380.56, "duration": 4.479}, {"text": "right it's either on or it's off it's", "start": 382.96, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "not a value in between it and that's", "start": 385.039, "duration": 4.641}, {"text": "perfect that is exactly what we want um", "start": 386.88, "duration": 4.319}, {"text": "so you can see that it's the way it", "start": 389.68, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "works is it's like the uh every the", "start": 391.199, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "distance after the marker in between", "start": 394.24, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "that and the next marker is that color", "start": 396.639, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "so this white value currently has no uh", "start": 398.24, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "contribution so i just got to move these", "start": 401.039, "duration": 4.241}, {"text": "along a little bit like so", "start": 402.8, "duration": 4.239}, {"text": "like that and you can also see very", "start": 405.28, "duration": 3.199}, {"text": "quickly like you can change the color", "start": 407.039, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "scheme of your sprinkles if you want", "start": 408.479, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "more yellow ones or more hot pink ones", "start": 410.319, "duration": 4.961}, {"text": "or whatever um it's just a really", "start": 412.479, "duration": 4.401}, {"text": "it's an easy way to actually like change", "start": 415.28, "duration": 3.919}, {"text": "the color scheme of the sprinkles it's a", "start": 416.88, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "it's kind of cool once you once you set", "start": 419.199, "duration": 4.241}, {"text": "this up like i i didn't want to do this", "start": 421.36, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "for like my tutorial three years ago", "start": 423.44, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "cause i was like i don't know like nodes", "start": 424.88, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "and random settings and color ramp it's", "start": 426.72, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "too advanced but then the feedback i got", "start": 428.8, "duration": 3.839}, {"text": "from that tutorial when i did a survey", "start": 431.12, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "was like everyone's like why didn't you", "start": 432.639, "duration": 4.241}, {"text": "use the random random set with color", "start": 434.24, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "ramp and i'm like how did you even know", "start": 436.88, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "that was a thing um i thought that was", "start": 438.0, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "too advanced but anyways so there we go", "start": 440.0, "duration": 5.039}, {"text": "we now have different colors yay across", "start": 442.88, "duration": 3.439}, {"text": "the whole thing", "start": 445.039, "duration": 2.56}, {"text": "you'll notice we've only put this into", "start": 446.319, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "the base color because everything else", "start": 447.599, "duration": 3.761}, {"text": "like the roughness and all that kind of", "start": 449.919, "duration": 2.961}, {"text": "thing that's going to be the same like", "start": 451.36, "duration": 3.119}, {"text": "those values across sprinkles they're", "start": 452.88, "duration": 2.96}, {"text": "not going to change", "start": 454.479, "duration": 3.041}, {"text": "it's really just the colors of the", "start": 455.84, "duration": 2.88}, {"text": "sprinkles", "start": 457.52, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "speaking of which by the way we should", "start": 458.72, "duration": 5.199}, {"text": "probably increase the roughness", "start": 460.96, "duration": 4.239}, {"text": "of the sprinkles so that they're a", "start": 463.919, "duration": 3.601}, {"text": "little bit more more like chalk looking", "start": 465.199, "duration": 3.68}, {"text": "because that's kind of what a lot of", "start": 467.52, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "sprinkles look like there's also", "start": 468.879, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "something that are shiny so it's really",
