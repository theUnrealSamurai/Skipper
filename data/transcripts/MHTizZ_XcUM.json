within this diameter or so,", "start": 39.7, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "the dart board helps out a little bit.", "start": 43.54, "duration": 2.48}, {"text": "And what's cool, is if you use this dart,", "start": 52.32, "duration": 2.42}, {"text": "it will make you the worlds best dart player,", "start": 54.74, "duration": 2.44}, {"text": "because you get a bullseye nearly every time,",

{"text": "it makes you the worlds worst dart player", "start": 62.16, "duration": 2.18}, {"text": "because it calculates the initial trajectory,", "start": 64.34, "duration": 2.1}, {"text": "and then moves the board in the exact opposite direction.", "start": 66.44, "duration": 3.02}, {"text": "So eventually we took this thing to a bar", "start": 71.76, "duration": 1.6}, {"text": "to see if it would work in the wild", "start": 73.36, "duration": 1.64}, {"text": "but before we get to that, let's talk about how it actually works.", "start": 75.0, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "Fundamentally, there are two main parts to this system.", "start": 78.92, "duration": 2.18}, {"text": "First, you need to somehow predict where a dart is going to land,", "start": 81.1, "duration": 3.22}, {"text": "with a typical throw from regulation distance,", "start": 84.46, "duration": 2.94}, {"text": "and you have about 200 milliseconds to do that.", "start": 87.4, "duration": 2.02}, {"text": "And then second, you need to somehow move the board", "start": 89.82, "duration": 2.72}, {"text": "to that predicted location,", "start": 92.54, "duration": 1.78}, {"text": "and you have about another 200 milliseconds to do that.", "start": 94.32, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "So let's start with the first part, about how we predict where the dart is going to land.", "start": 97.02, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "So the real secret here is that our dart has these tiny retroreflectors on it,", "start": 100.5, "duration": 3.86}, {"text": "And then we have a VICON motion capture system.", "start": 104.36, "duration": 1.96}, {"text": "As humans, we can see in 3D because we have 2 eyes,", "start": 106.68, "duration": 3.68}, {"text": "And our brain calculates the difference between the two images,", "start": 110.36, "duration": 3.1}, {"text": "and then tells us how far or close things are.", "start": 113.46, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "This is why if you close one eye,", "start": 116.16, "duration": 1.64}, {"text": "you instantly lose that depth perception.", "start": 117.8, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "So that's basically what we're doing here,", "start": 119.96, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "Except we have 6 \"eyes\" all around the room,", "start": 121.76, "duration": 2.72}, {"text": "And each of these \"eyes\" or cameras can take a 4K resolution picture,", "start": 124.62, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "260 times per second.", "start": 129.4, "duration": 1.54}, {"text": "But since it's hard to visually separate something so small,", "start": 130.94, "duration": 3.02}, {"text": "moving so fast in front of a busy background,", "start": 133.96, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "they actually use IR.", "start": 136.76, "duration": 1.44}, {"text": "So they blast out IR from all these IR LEDs", "start": 138.5, "duration": 2.72}, {"text": "and then it hits the retroreflectors, and then bounces back to the lens.", "start": 141.56, "duration": 3.1}, {"text": "So when I wave the dart around like this,", "start": 144.66, "duration": 2.04}, {"text": "this is what you and I see,", "start": 146.7, "duration": 1.22}, {"text": "but the motion capture system just sees a solitary dart, floating around.", "start": 147.92, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "One of the reasons this board took us so long to build", "start": 152.24, "duration": 2.8}, {"text": "was that for the first 2 years, we were trying to make our own motion capture systems,", "start": 155.04, "duration": 3.22}, {"text": "so we had our own cameras,", "start": 158.4, "duration": 1.68}, {"text": "and one of these awesome NVIDIA TX1 boards which is basically like a Raspberry Pi,", "start": 160.08, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "on Russian steroids.", "start": 164.4, "duration": 1.16}, {"text": "But it turns out, it's a super complex problem to solve, and the VICON system was just turn key.", "start": 165.56, "duration": 4.64}, {"text": "So now that we have the XYZ position of the dart as it travels through the air,", "start": 170.2, "duration": 3.7}, {"text": "we used some MATLAB code to then predict, where it will land.", "start": 173.9, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "And the trick here is that anything you throw into the air (neglecting air resistance),", "start": 178.0, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "will travel in a perfect parabola.", "start": 181.8, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "Even something you wouldn't think of like a high jumper.", "start": 184.12, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "If you track their center of mass, it actually follows a perfect parabola shape.", "start": 186.72, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "So we used our understanding of parabolas, and from a side view,", "start": 190.78, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "we used that to predict the final up and down position of the board.", "start": 194.14, "duration": 3.08}, {"text": "And then to predict the final left right position of the board, we know from a bottom view", "start": 197.22, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "a dart will follow a linear path.", "start": 201.54, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "So we used good old y = mx + b, and the y intercept", "start": 203.82, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "or b in this case, tells you how to move it left and right for the final position.", "start": 206.86, "duration": 4.92}, {"text": "So now that we know where to move, let's talk about how we actually do it.", "start": 225.52, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "So the board itself is on two linear sliders which allows it to translate to any specific location.", "start": 230.08, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "So that provides the track on where to move, but the engine would be these 6 stepper motors", "start": 236.08, "duration": 5.06}, {"text": "you can see from the front.", "start": 241.14, "duration": 1.38}, {"text": "Each motor has a spool and then some fishing line, and they all attach to the center of the back of the board right here.", "start": 242.52, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "Once we have the predicted bullseye spot, the computer does the trigonometry,", "start": 249.24, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "and then sends the commands over here to the motors.", "start": 252.68, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "So to move to the left, it would say like \"you need to spin up, but you need to unspin at the same rate\".", "start": 254.92, "duration": 5.32}, {"text": "Now you can see in the back the computer signal comes into this Arduino compatible board here,", "start": 260.24, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "and then you got some preamps here that bump up the voltage signal", "start": 264.24, "duration": 2.68}, {"text": "to the 6 individual stepper motor controllers,", "start": 266.92, "duration": 2.66}, {"text": "and these stepper motor drivers take the moving instructions,", "start": 269.58, "duration": 2.46}, {"text": "and combine it with the power from the plug in the wall,", "start": 272.04, "duration": 2.42}, {"text": "after it goes through this AC/DC power converter", "start": 274.46, "duration": 2.38}, {"text": "and then finally a bunch of voltage pulses from the motor controller cause the motor to take small steps and either wind up, or wind down.", "start": 276.84, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "Now keep in mind, all of this happens in less than half a second,", "start": 282.68, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "and allows us to hit our sub millimeter precision in our board positioning.", "start": 285.72, "duration": 4.14}, {"text": "And we don't just make one guess on the final position of the board,", "start": 289.86, "duration": 4.14}, {"text": "we update and refine that guess anywhere from 10 to 100 times,", "start": 294.26, "duration": 5.0}, {"text": "which is why sometimes you sort of see the board jitter into the final position.", "start": 299.26, "duration": 3.8}, {"text": "So we took it to a bar to see what people thought.", "start": 308.74, "duration": 2.1}, {"text": "In general we found if you're really drunk, you get so pumped at your new
