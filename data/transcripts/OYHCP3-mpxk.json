from the\npivot, this creates a torque which", "start": 219.76, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "rotates the pendulum until the mass is\nback below the pivot", "start": 223.72, "duration": 3.26}, {"text": "so for the drone to swing like a pendulum, the pull from\ngravity must be offset from the pivot point", "start": 226.98, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "now since gravity doesn't choose\nto pull at a random point on an object", "start": 232.38, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "we say that it acts at the center of\nmass", "start": 235.84, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "which is the same position at which the object balances", "start": 239.02, "duration": 3.06}, {"text": "but where is the\npivot point?", "start": 242.08, "duration": 1.68}, {"text": "by throwing an object into the air whilst giving it a spin", "start": 243.76, "duration": 2.82}, {"text": "we can see that it rotates around its center", "start": 246.58, "duration": 2.54}, {"text": "which makes sense if you've ever thrown\na frisbee", "start": 249.12, "duration": 3.24}, {"text": "if we add mass to one side of the object", "start": 252.36, "duration": 2.08}, {"text": "it shifts the center of mass\nto that side", "start": 254.44, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "but what does this do when it's throwing into the air", "start": 257.02, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "it seems to\nbe rotating around the new center of mass", "start": 259.86, "duration": 2.9}, {"text": "and this is where the\nbiggest misconception of drone stability originates from", "start": 262.76, "duration": 4.3}, {"text": "it seems logical to\nassume that the drone pivots around it's point of thrust", "start": 267.06, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "and the mass falls down\nlike a pendulum", "start": 271.26, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "but in fact the pivot

{"text": "if you try to fly drone with a really low center of mass", "start": 282.86, "duration": 2.86}, {"text": "all that happens is the\ndrones rotational inertia is increased", "start": 285.72,

"duration": 2.33}, {"text": "so why don't the propellers act the same as a pivot point on a pendulum", "start": 295.26, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "it's easier to visualise this by displaying the thrust as a fixed force acting on the drone", "start": 299.26, "duration": 5.56}, {"text": "when the drone\ntilts so does the line of thrust", "start": 304.82, "duration": 3.34}, {"text": "therefore there is no correction torque\nand the thrust just launches it sideways", "start": 308.16, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "if we compare this to a tilted pendulum\nand display the pivot as a force acting directly upwards", "start": 312.6, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "it's clear that this isn't achievable by the propellers in their current mounted situation", "start": 317.96, "duration": 5.2}, {"text":

3.929}, {"text": "the drone are balanced about the pivot\ntherefore there is no rotation", "start": 329.26, "duration": 4.28}, {"text": "whereas the pendulum has an imbalance and wants\nto rotate", "start": 333.54, "duration": 4.02}, {"text": "when designing a drone or any kind of flying machine I like to think of them as being in zero gravity", "start": 337.56, "duration": 5.26}, {"text": "this forces you to ignore any kind of\npendulum effects and actually focus on", "start": 342.82, "duration": 5.18}, {"text": "the forces produced around the pivot\npoint or the center of mass", "start": 348.0, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "so for this next part of the video I'm going to run\nthrough all of my previous flying", "start": 351.46, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "machine projects and hopefully explain\nthe control theory behind them", "start": 354.96, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "let's start with the electric ducted fan\nrocket designed to simulate the control", "start": 359.94, "duration": 3.759}, {"text": "of a SpaceX Falcon 9", "start": 363.7, "duration": 2.22}, {"text": "it's essentially a large tube which uses\nthrust-vectoring at the bottom for control", "start": 378.6, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "but where is the ideal center of\nmass?", "start": 382.61, "duration": 4.27}, {"text": "If we label the thrust as a force", "start": 386.88, "duration": 1.58}, {"text": "acting at the bottom of the tube and\nrotate the thrust vector to one side", "start": 388.46, "duration": 4.68}, {"text": "we can see that moving the mass to the top creates a large thrust offset from the center of mass", "start": 393.14, "duration": 5.7}, {"text": "therefore providing a\ngreater control torque", "start": 398.84, "duration": 3.14}, {"text": "if the centre of mass was at the bottom, the thrust\nvectoring would be useless", "start": 401.98, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "as there is no offset from the centre of mass", "start": 406.46, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "so having the thrust vectoring far from the", "start": 408.62, "duration": 1.89}, {"text": "center of mass makes it possible for\nthis tube to maintain a controlled hover", "start": 410.51, "duration": 4.69}, {"text": "until the motor burns out", "start": 428.34, "duration": 2.48}, {"text": "the next example is a radio-controlled Chinook model", "start": 430.82, "duration": 2.98}, {"text": "this doesn't fly anything like the\nreal Chinook but instead has thrust vectored propellers", "start": 436.94, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "at the top of the craft, essentially being the reverse of the previous example", "start": 441.56, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "so here it is\nflying without the Chinook body", "start": 445.48, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "the motors are able to pivot around this\npoint to vector the thrust for control", "start": 448.12, "duration": 4.02}, {"text": "so where would the ideal center of mass\nbe?", "start": 452.14, "duration": 3.54}, {"text": "you would in fact be correct if you", "start": 455.68, "duration": 1.69}, {"text": "suggested lowering the center of mass as\nthat to achieve a maximum thrust offset", "start": 457.37, "duration": 4.59}, {"text": "not to get confused with the pendulum\nfallacy", "start": 461.96, "duration": 3.9}, {"text": "and the final example is my recently built gas thruster drone", "start": 465.86, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "because this drone has the thrust fixed in\nthe center the thrust line is always", "start": 479.8, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "going straight through the center of\nmass and therefore creates no

thrust", "start": 497.24, "duration": 4.3}, {"text": "it would simply shift the pivot\npoint downward slightly", "start": 501.54, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "therefore the only way to control this
