5.97}, {"text": "so and then I'm gonna hit command C ( Ctrl C)\nto copy that frame and then I'm just", "start": 299.03, "duration": 5.43}, {"text": "gonna lasso and select all of them\nright-click and

"through frame by frame and decide which\nframes are bad at which one sort of", "start": 316.82, "duration": 4.23}, {"text": "reduce the quality and also realign them\nso what I'm going to do is move to the", "start": 321.05, "duration": 4.95}, {"text": "right and you can see that the\ntrampoline jumps a bit so to realign", "start": 326.0, "duration": 5.1}, {"text": "them what I'm going to do is drag this\nframe up and then pull it over so it's", "start": 331.1, "duration": 5.55}, {"text": "stacked on top of this first frame and\nthen with it selected I'm going to", "start": 336.65,

kind of see what the second frame", "start": 345.86, "duration": 5.67}, {"text": "looks like overlap so what we want to do\nis use the position controls to align", "start": 351.53, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "this so that way it's as centered to the\nother frame as possible now it's not", "start": 356.81, "duration": 5.55}, {"text": "perfect but that's much better and then\nwe can increase the opacity back to a", "start": 362.36, "duration": 4.41}, {"text": "100 and then we can roll this back\nso now there's less of a jump there", "start": 366.77, "duration": 7.38}, {"text": "let's go to the next one and do the same\nthing and I'm gonna pull this over and", "start": 374.15, "duration": 6.26}, {"text": "then up here I'm just going to make the\nopacity 25% and I'm going to reposition",

frame by frame to do\nthis", "start": 393.59, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "just going to quickly go through and make\nsure all of them are aligned so this is", "start": 397.09, "duration": 5.579},

it wasn't perfect so", "start": 406.63, "duration": 4.47}, {"text": "it's kind of not as fluid as I would\nhave hoped so maybe the next time I try", "start": 411.1, "duration": 4.77}, {"text": "this experiment I'll actually try to get\na bunch of cameras and I think there are", "start": 415.87, "duration": 4.95}, {"text": "some cheaper cameras on Amazon that you\ncan get as a set to do this effect all", "start": 420.82, "duration": 4.23}, {"text": "in one go it may be hard to do a full\n360 but at least I could do a 180 set up", "start": 425.05, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "and maybe do a much better job so that's\nit and how you create this effect doing", "start": 431.11, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "frame by frame with one camera so I hope\nthat you guys enjoyed the 360 matrix",
